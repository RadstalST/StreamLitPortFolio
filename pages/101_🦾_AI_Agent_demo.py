This is a demo of the AI Agent that I built using OpenAI's API and LangChan. 
## capabilities
- The AI Agent can answer questions based on the information on the internet by using DuckDuckGo's API and Wikipedia's API.
- The AI Agent can plan and execute a plan to solve a problem.
- The AI Agent do math.

## Inner Workings
The AI agent works by dividing the task into two parts: planning and execution.
### 1. Planning
the AI agent uses the planning model to plan the steps to solve the problem. In this case 
```python
planner = load_chat_planner(planner_model,)
```

### 2. Execution
the AI agent uses the execution model to execute the plan. In this case
```python
executor = load_agent_executor(llm, tools, verbose=True)
```
the load_agent_executor function loads the agent executor
which are able to use the provided tools:
- Web Search > DuckDuckGo
- Wikipedia > Wikipedia
- Calculator > LLMMathChain

### 3. Putting it all together
```python
agent = PlanAndExecute(planner=planner, executor=executor, verbose=True)
```

## Conclusion
The AI agent is able to answer questions based on the information on the internet by using DuckDuckGo's API and Wikipedia's API.
